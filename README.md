# Dungeon-Delver
This is a prototype of a game that I worked on with a team of three. I was tasked with designing the combat and movement mechanics. As an added bonus, I designed the enemy AI so that they can move and injure the player.

Overview:
This Dungeon Delver project is inspired by the Legend of Zelda (1986) in terms of art style and gameplay. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the dungeon and defeat the boss that is residing in his room.

Controls:
* The player can move with W,A,S,D in the respective direction.
* When it is acquired, the player can make use of a grapple hook with "E".
  * Tip: The grappler is being held by a skeleton in the starting room with the player.
* There are some locked doors throughout the dungeon, these can be opened with a key by approaching the sealed door.
  * Tip: The keys will be tucked away in different rooms throughout the dungeon.
